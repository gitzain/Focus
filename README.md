## Motivation
On average, people check their phones over 150 times a day, causing constant distractions and reduced productivity. I wanted a simple, quick, and intuitive solution to manage these interruptions. That's why I created Focus, an app that instantly silences your phone when placed face down and unsilences it when turned face up, helping you stay focused with minimal effort.

UPDATE: This project was started in 2020. Now, most phones come with this feature by default, reducing the need for a separate app like Focus.


## Installation & Usage
### Installation
The app is no longer available on the app store. To install, build the APK from source.

### Usage
After installing the app, open it and follow the on-screen instructions. Once set up, simply place your phone face down to enter focus mode, and pick it back up to unsilence it.
